## Code of conduct

PRs are welcome. To contribute to this repo, first `fork` it, create a local `branch` with some meaningful name, and start working. When you are done, submit a `PR` and I'll review it.

### General rules

We are _not_ using `class` based components, only [`stateless function`](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component#react-stateless-function-component) components. You _must_ follow the rules set by the provided [`ESlint`](https://eslint.org/) configuration. [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) package is applied, so you will not be able to commit to this repository if the requirements are not met.

Example:

```
/**
* @author zilahir
* @function MenuItem
* */

const MenuItem = () => (
	<div>MenuItem</div>
)

export default MenuItem
```

**NOTE:** Please comment your components under the import section, so it's purpose will be clearly stated.

1. We are using `flex-grid` system in this project. More particularly [this](https://roylee0704.github.io/react-flexbox-grid/) one.

2. We are using [`css modules`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet), but with `scss` syntax. Keep the `scss` as organizad as possible, try to avoid _endless_ nesting.

3. You are **not** allowed to use `#id` selectors.

4. Write as generic components as possible to help reusability.

5. Using [`prop-types`](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are mandatory. Read the docs of `prop-types` [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) if you are not familiar with it.

6. Try to avoid installing 3rd party `react` components, unless it's a must. Try to implement everything by your own.

## Hooks

Since `hooks` has been introduced to `react`, let's aim to use them.

For example:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false)
```

and when you need to set it's value

```
setIsVisible(true)
```

Read more about `react-hooks` in it's [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)

For `hooks` follow the naming conventions, as in the example above. If a variable needs to be set to a specific value, use the `set` in the naming, so it will be consequent, and readable.

## Project structure

Each component have to be in `components` folder.

1. in `common/<component-name>`, if it's a _common_ component.

2. in `pages/<page-name>`, if it's a page.

## Folder structure

The structure of the folders tried to be kept as consistent and self explanary explanatory as possible. Everything goes where it belongs.

```markdown
├── App.js
├── App.test.js
├── actions
│ ├── actionTypes.js
│ └── test.js
├── assets
│ └── img
├── components
│ ├── Footer
│ │ ├── Footer.module.scss
│ │ └── index.js
│ └── common
│ ├── Button
│ │ ├── Button.module.scss
│ │ └── index.js
├── reducers
│ └── test.js
├── pages
│ ├── Home
│ │ ├── Home.module.scss
│ │ └── index.js
└── styles
├── mixins
│ ├── Button.scss
└── variables.scss
```

The `filenames` and `foldernames` should be in the following format:

`<SomeComponent>` / `index.js` / `SomeComponent.module.scss`

## Naming conventions

We are using `camelCase` naming conventons for both variable names, and `classNames`, for example:

`TopHeader`, `isVisible`, etc.

The `scss modules` are always important for a specific component as `styles`.

```
import styles from ./TopHeader.module.scss
```

and then referencing them as:

```
<div className={styles.topHeaderWrapper}>
    ...
</div>
```

`styled-component` are part if this repository also, use it if a component requires styles related props, such as `color`, `width`, etc.

Example:

```
import styled from 'styled-components`

const DemoStyledComponent = styled.span`
    display: flex;
    &:before {
        content: '';
        width: ${props =>  props.width}px;
        ...
        ...
        ...
    }
`
```

And then referencing them as the following:

`<DemoStyledComponent width={200} />`

Using the `!important` rule in `CSS` is strictly forbidden. If you come accross a problem which can be solved by using `!important` you need to redefine your `CSS`, or your `component` or both.

Follow the rules of `HTML` tag nesting, to avoid `validateDOMnesting(...)` warnings.

## Fonts

We are using two different font familier here. Both provided by `Google fonts`.

1. `KoHo`
2. `Roboto`

The headings (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) are `KoHo`, and body texts (`p`, `span`, etc.) are `Roboto`.

## Contents

Even for placeholders, it's **forbidden** to hardcode _any_ texts into the code. Let's _mimic_ some `API`, to help in the future connect some `graphQl`. Future plan is once the initial release is done, port this to [`gatsbyJs`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

Example:

```
export const headerMenu = {
	menuItems: [
		{ key: 1, label: 'Home', slug: 'home' },
		{ key: 2, label: 'About us', slug: 'aboutus' },
	],
	getHeaderMenu: () => headerMenu.menuItems,
}
```

Then reference it as the following:

```
import { headerMenu } from <path-to-file>

const menuItem = headerMenu.getHeaderMenu();

```

## Dependencies

Here's a list of _important_ dependencies we are using in this project:

1. [`gatsbyJS`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
1. [`framer-motion`](https://github.com/framer/motion)
1. [`react-waypoint`](https://github.com/civiccc/react-waypoint)
1. [`redux`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
1. [`redux-thunk`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) (_not in use currently_)
1. [`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
1. [`react-parallax`](https://github.com/RRutsche/react-parallax)
1. [`react-responsive`](https://github.com/contra/react-responsive)
1. [`react-map-gl`](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl#readme)

Please read the documentation of these packages if you are not familiar with them.

## MapBox

On the website, there is a map incuded. To be able to use it, you need to provide your own `TOKEN` for it. To learn how to use the tokens, visit the related [part](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl#about-mapbox-tokens) of the documentation.

Since we are using `gatsbyJS`, you must the related way of declaring `env` variables.

`Gatsby` prefixes the `env` variables with `GATSBY_`, so your token will be something like:

```
GATSBY_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOURTOKEN>
```
